    "Welcome to the Springboard Regression case study! Please note: this is ***Tier 2*** of the case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study was designed for you to **use Python to apply the knowledge you've acquired in reading *The Art of Statistics* (hereinafter *AoS*) by Professor Spiegelhalter**. Specifically, the case study will get you doing regression analysis; a method discussed in Chapter 5 on p.121. It might be useful to have the book open at that page when doing the case study to remind you of what it is we're up to (but bear in mind that other statistical concepts, such as training and testing, will be applied, so you might have to glance at other chapters too).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to ***use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a model that's as accurate as possible***. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll try a *univariate* analysis (one involving a single explanatory variable) as well as a *multivariate* one (involving multiple explanatory variables), and we'll iterate together towards a decent model by the end of the notebook. The main thing is for you to see how regression analysis looks in Python and jupyter, and to get some practice implementing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this case study, **questions** will be asked in the markdown cells. Try to **answer these yourself in a simple text file** when they come up. Most of the time, the answers will become clear as you progress through the notebook. Some of the answers may require a little research with Google and other basic resources available to every data scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we're going to use the red wine dataset, wineQualityReds.csv. Make sure it's downloaded and sitting in your working directory. This is a very common dataset for practicing regression analysis and is actually freely available on Kaggle, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "You're pretty familiar with the data science pipeline at this point. This project will have the following structure: \n",
    "**1. Sourcing and loading** \n",
    "- Import relevant libraries\n",
    "- Load the data \n",
    "- Exploring the data\n",
    "- Choosing a dependent variable\n",

    "**2. Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing**\n",
    "- Visualizing correlations\n",

    "- Making a Linear regression model: your first model\n",
    "- Making a Linear regression model: your second model: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) \n",
    "- Making a Linear regression model: your third model: multiple linear regression\n",

While our most predictively powerful model was rModel3, this model had explanatory variables that were correlated with one another, which made some redundancy. Our most elegant and economical model was rModel4 - it used just a few predictors to get a good result. \n",
